# Hello-World

My name is Gloria. I am a recently retired grandmother looking to gain experience as a web-developer so I can work from home.  I have a background in technology, but mostly in database design and end-user support.  However, I did design a Filemaker application for the mentoring program for the local school system.  This was only a couple of years ago, and since then I have made the application much better and am attempting to market it.  Filemaker is a good tool, but I feel like I should work with something more universal like web-development.  Though I attended a university for database design, I learned a lot on my own.  I know that I am not the typical person you would see interested in learning to code, but that's never stopped me before.  So I will plug along and see how it goes. So for now, Hello everyone.
